# Hi-Run
Hi Run, My first little app!

Introduce:

Keep running while you run.
"Hi Run" is specifically designed to help you focus on your workout.
Listening to music while running is very conducive to the release of sports pain, especially when listening to good music.
With this program, you can start running and listen to the running music you choose.
This is a very effective way to help you reach your running goals.
Every workout will be accompanied by your music to the end and happy mood.

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
